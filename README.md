# scGPT Playground

Me playing around with scGPT repository - applying this foundation model to different omic datasets!

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **data/**: Contains all datasets used for experiments.
  - `annotation_pancreas/`: Includes data for pancreas annotation tasks.
  - `cellxgene/`: Scripts and configuration files related to CellxGene.
  - `test_1/`: Test datasets for preliminary experiments.

- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks used for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
  - `evaluate_embeddings.ipynb`: Evaluating embeddings generated by scGPT.
  - `evaluate_fine_tuned_embeddings.ipynb`: Evaluating fine-tuned embeddings.
  - `get_embeddings.ipynb`: Scripts to generate embeddings.
  - `preprocess_data.ipynb`: Initial data preprocessing steps.
  - `Tutorial_Annotation.ipynb`: A tutorial for data annotation.

- **outputs/**: Directory to store output files from experiments.
  - `run-24-08-21-01/`, `run-24-08-21-02/` . . . : Different runs of experiments with corresponding outputs.

- **scripts/**: Various scripts and configuration files for running experiments.
  - `config/`: JSON configuration files for different cluster setups.
  - `logs/`: Logs generated during script execution.
  - `wandb/`: Weights and Biases experiment tracking configurations.
